NHS patients to monitor heart disease and diabetes AT HOME within ten From thesun.co.uk
Christmas and new year’s holidays are the times. The doctors are not only available on weekend, but they are also there to serve you on public holidays. Our home visits are reserved mainly for very sick, housebound or vulnerable people who would find it impossible to visit the surgery in person. It is recognised good practice for general practices to have systems in place to triage and prioritise home visits.
